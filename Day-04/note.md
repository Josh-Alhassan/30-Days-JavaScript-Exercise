# Conditionals

Conditional statements are used to make decisions based on different conditions. 

The sequential flow of execution in JavaScript can be altered in two ways
- Conditional execution: If a certain expression is *'true'*, a block of one or more statments will be executed.

- Repetitive Execution: As long as a certain expression is *true*, a block of one or more statements will be repetively executed.

Conditionals can be implemented using the following ways:

* if
* if else
* if else if else
* switch
* ternary operator

## If statement
The keyword *if* is used to check if a conditional is *true* and to execute the block code.

```
// Syntax
if (condition) {
  // this part of code runs for the truthy condition
}
```

## IF else statment
If condition is *true* the first block will be executed. If not the else condition will executed

```
// syntax
if (condition) {
  // this part of code runs for truthy condition
} else {
  // this part of code runs for falsy condition
}
```
## if else-if else

```
syntax
if (condition) {
  // code
} else if (condition) {
  //code
} else {
  // code
}

```
